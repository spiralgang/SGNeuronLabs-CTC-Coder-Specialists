# Qualcomm® AI Hub

### Deploy optimized models on real devices in minutes

**What is Qualcomm® AI Hub?**  
Qualcomm® AI Hub streamlines deploying AI models for vision, audio, and speech applications to edge devices. Optimize, validate, and deploy models on hosted Qualcomm® platforms in minutes.  
- **Automatic Model Optimization:** Convert PyTorch or ONNX models for efficient on-device deployment using TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, or Qualcomm AI Runtime—targeting CPU, GPU, or NPU.
- **Model Library:** Access 100+ open-source, pre-optimized models for vision, speech, audio, and text—deployable on Snapdragon® and Qualcomm®-powered devices. Recipes available on [GitHub](https://github.com/quic/ai-hub-models) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qualcomm-AI-Hub).
- **Real Device Testing:** Instantly provision hosted Qualcomm® platform devices for on-device inference and profiling with minimal code.
